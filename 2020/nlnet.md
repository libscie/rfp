## Grant questions

### Can you explain the whole project and its expected outcome(s). [1200 chars]
Hypergraph fundamentally changes research communication in order to address issues of ‘publish or perish’ science, introducing new user concepts that require thoughtfully designed user interactions.

The first design challenge is that Hypergraph changes the format of research communication. As a tool, it helps researchers document their research step-by-step (e.g., theory  hypotheses  study materials  data  code), addressing selective publication and questionable research practices. This new format has no user interaction framework available to guide researchers into thinking about communicating research steps instead of research articles. What interaction designs help researchers understand and use this new format with minimal friction? 

The second design challenge is that Hypergraph utilises decentralised, peer-to-peer Web technologies to make paywalls a thing of the past. Concepts from the centralised Web no longer apply, which requires a new user interaction framework. For example, “login/signup/password reset” is replaced by cryptographic keys, but how can we make keys manageable for regular users? Other issues include permission management and user privacy.

Within this grant, we will design and test user interactions to didactically address both design challenges and maximise the impact of this tool to improve the quality of and access to research.

### Have you been involved with projects or organisations relevant to this project before? And if so, can you tell us a bit about your contributions? [opt]

The conceptual and technical designs of the research tool are the result of my PhD research (“Contributions towards understanding and building sustainable science”; doi.org/10.31237/osf.io/4wtpc). In order to institutionalise and realise this vision and improve research quality, I founded the worker coop Liberate Science GmbH (https://libscie.org).

### Explain what the requested budget will be used for? Does the project have other funding sources, both past and present? (If you want, you can in addition attach a budget at the bottom of the form)
The requested budget will be used to hire a UX designer for one year; they will work on the design issues of (1) stepwise research communication and (2) the decentralised Web. 

#### Previous funding: 
-	The research underpinning Hypergraph was funded by the Mozilla Foundation (~$60,000) and the US Department of HHS/ORI (~$110,000) over the past 4 years
#### Current funding: 
-	Liberate Science GmbH is funded by the Shuttleworth Foundation to $275,000/year for at most three years (started September 2019)


### Compare your own project with existing or historical efforts.
Already in 1998, researchers affiliated with Elsevier suggested that the article format should be supplemented by a new format, where research steps would be communicated as-you-go to provide a more accurate depiction of how research is done. To date, only the platform Octopus developed by Alexandra Freeman also implements this idea, which has not launched yet.

The design challenges of the decentralised Web are being worked on by multiple projects. We do not aim to replace those projects but 
### What are significant technical challenges you expect to solve during the project, if any?
Key management

### Describe the ecosystem of the project, and how you will engage with relevant actors and promote the outcomes?
