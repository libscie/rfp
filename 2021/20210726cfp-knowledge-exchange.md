# Bid4PIDs: Liberate Science GmbH

Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) help uniquely identify objects throughout a wide range of physical and digital domains â€”  episodes of TV shows, movies, government reports, books, datasets, and much more. PIDs are often misunderstood; for example they are commonly considered as identifying digital objects, but are a way of digitally identifying objects, which are two substantively different things. Within the scholarly domain, more specific demands are made on sometimes general identifiers, raising additional issues.

In this proposal, we outline our work to help the Task and Finish Group (T&F) answer questions around how PIDs mitigate or enlarge risk, and how they help build or dismantle trust in research infrastructures.

## Summary

We provide a 40 day project plan (49,125EUR) to investigate the boundary conditions of risk and trust in Persistent Identifiers for research, with the project report delivered at the end of May, 2022. The project plan runs from September 1st, 2021 through October 1st, 2022.

Our case studies focus on eliciting extreme information regarding trust and risk in Persistent Identifiers. This helps us identify upper and lower boundaries of risk and trust, and enable recommendations in the final report to be of largest marginal value to the goal of a well-functioning research infrastructure. In our final analysis, we will evaluate which recommendations are low-hanging fruit, and provide a high rate of return when implemented.

During this project, all reports are generated using reproducible documents to improve verifiability of results, and ease extension of findings based on the insights from the T&F group. The project is managed using the Open Science Framework, and each deliverable can be made public or kept private on a granular basis.

## About

[Liberate Science GmbH](https://libscie.org) (inc. 2019, Berlin) is repairing knowledge distribution, by building community and open infrastructures around publishing research steps (modules), instead of research projects.

We bring research experience, software engineering experience, and a business perspective to open science. To support our efforts on building equitable open infrastructures, we provide consulting that strategically aligns with our mission to repair knowledge distribution. 

All our consultants are researchers and have skin in the game, bringing a unique perspective on policy issues. Any consulting efforts directly help us finance the development of alternative, open publishing systems. 

This is our first bid on a consulting project, and we appreciate any feedback you may have to improve our bids in the future.

### Bid motivation

Previously, we researched Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs), which resulted in a [DOI Primer](https://blog.libscie.org/doi-primer/). As we build our own open infrastructure, we continuously think about which PIDs to use, whether there's a need for innovation, and how to use PIDs in a responsible manner. 

This consulting opportunity is strategically aligned with the work we are currently undertaking, and the experiences of one of our consultants as an expert in KE was highly enjoyable, which serves as a motivation to provide support for this T&F group.

### Team

#### Chris Hartgerink (PhD, consultant)

Director of Liberate Science GmbH. PhD in Methodology and Statistics (Tilburg University, 2020) with extensive experience in meta-analysis, data analysis, designing and constructing surveys, and policy support (e.g., copyright reform at European level, open science policies at university level). Previously served as expert in a Task and Finish Group for Knowledge Exchange.

#### Patrick Sobrak-Seaton (designer, support staff)

In-house designer for Liberate Science GmbH. Brings a rich background in visual design and UI/UX design. Will provide support to consultant where necessary throughout the project.

### Project management

We will use a private Open Science Framework project hosted in Europe to manage the project. All T&F members will be provided access to this project, and each deliverable will be managed in sub-projects. Each deliverable can be made public on a granular basis, as desired by the T&F group.

## Deliverable 1: Case studies

We deliver six case studies based on semi-structured interviews with all of the KE participants (see Deliverable 2 for details) to assess the extremes of riskiness and trustworthiness in PIDs. These case studies aim to discover boundary conditions, and stretch those boundaries towards more and less risk/trust to provide recommendations that help increase quality for current and future implementations. 

These case studies seek the largest marginal value for risk and trust in its recommendations, and therefore focuses on boundary conditions in the interviews.

Each case study report will provide: 

- (Unique) PIDs utilized by KE participants
- Visual summary cards, presenting immediately comparable themes across the case studies (e.g., "most trustworthy PID is X").
- Key quotes
- Individual recommendations by participant, seen distinctly from recommendations across the case studies

alongside an in-depth description of how PIDs are evaluated in relation to a well-functioning research infrastructure. Each case study will be provided at a similar length.

## Deliverable 2: Questions and responses gathered

Prior to our semi-structured interviews, we compile a comprehensive list of PIDs, ranging across various domains and use cases. This will help expand the scope of the interviews to PIDs in existence outside of research, instead of PIDs commonly known by participants in the research domain. Prior to each interview, we will provide the KE participant with this list in survey form, and they can check each PID used by their institute.

Our interview questions seek the extreme situations, in order to identify core themes in the PID space that can form the basis for recommendations with the most marginal value. We conduct these interviews from an empathetic position, where we ask the participants for their gut responses first, and try to help uncover what underlies those gut assessments. We do not seek to cover all concerns for each participant, but the most extreme ones, where we expect that participants will self-disclose more nuanced positions throughout the interview.

For each of the six interviews (60-90 minutes), we ask the KE participants questions in the following framework:

1. Which PID feels ... to you?
    1. Most risky
    2. Most trustworthy
    3. Least risky
    4. Least trustworthy
2. Why does [PID] feel [most/least] [risky/trustworthy] to you?
3. What would make a PID [even/less] [riskier/trustworthy] than this one for you?
4. What would make [PID] [less/more] [risky/trustworthy] for you?
5. If you could change one thing about [PID], what would be of most value to you?

Throughout these interviews, we will utilize the themes of interest and the PID roles described in the scoping document to help elicit meaningful answers. High priority questions for the T&F group can be included during the review process for the interview, as we expand on this boundary condition approach for the interviews.

The interviews will be conducted through Zoom in English, and the audio recording will be processed using the service [Descript](https://www.descript.com/) to provide transcriptions. We use [Descript's human transcription service](https://www.descript.com/transcription) to get more accurate transcriptions (costs included in expense budget; see Costs). 

Transcripts will be slightly edited for readability (e.g., removing filler words).

Transcripts are delivered to Knowledge Exchange in a variety of raw formats that can easily be processed (Word document, Markdown, PDF). Raw audio files are deleted after the T&F has signed off on the transcripts.

## Deliverable 3: Outcomes and conclusions

Using the open source software [Taguette](https://www.taguette.org/), we follow a four stage qualitative analysis of the case study transcripts, for insights across the case studies. 

1. Extract risk statements and trust statements related to PIDs in general, or specific PIDs
2. Evaluate each statement as a increasing or decreasing risk/trust
3. Extract the independent variable and dependent variable (PID) for each statement
4. Categorise each risk statement into the Open Scholarship Framework categories

We will provide annotated copies of the transcripts to the T&F group for (optional) review, and provide a dataset including all extracted statements and classifications from each case study.

The dataset is used to analyze the frequencies of statements related to each aspect of the Open Scholarship Framework, to provide an indication of observability of issues, and provide insights into what issues may remain unobservable in these case studies. For example, if no statements are made about risk or trust on the macro policy level of the political arena, this could be an indication that the case studies 

All analyses of the data will be provided in a reproducible document, to facilitate reuse and exploration by third parties.

## Deliverable 4: Final publication

For the final report, we create a reproducible document incorporating automated displays of the data available within and across the case studies. We will include parts of the outcome and conclusion, and formulate concrete recommendations that are related to specific to the themes of interest, the PID roles, or the Open Scholarship Framework.

We provide a reflection on the case studies, with limitations and avenues for future work. We consider it important to position this report as part of the scholarly debate around PIDs and help the T&F or KE identify potential future areas for monitoring or research. In our own work, we already keep up with the PID literature, which will provide the basis of a contextualization of the case studies.

We will also provide an analysis of the most important recommendations as to difficulty to implement, and categorize which recommendations can be considered "low-hanging fruit" for a well-functioning research infrastructure.

## Deliverable 5: Support in disseminating the final publication

We provide the following support for disseminating the final publication:

- Mention in our newsletter distribution (circa 300 researchers)
- Mention of the key findings in the Open Update podcast (circa 20-30 weekly listeners)
- Social media sharing:
    - Eight prepared tweet threads (one per case study, one for the outcomes, and one for core recommendations)
    - Redistribution through the @libscie Twitter account (circa 1,000 followers)
    - *Optional*: GIFs optimized for social media sharing for each case study (2 days of work)
- Posting to relevant fora, Slack channels, and email lists (e.g., PIDforum, Invest in Open Infrastructure Slack; at least five)
- *Optional*: A modern, responsive microsite presenting key findings (hosting and domain name provided for five years through expenses; additional 5 days of work)
- *Optional*: Present key findings at PIDapalooza 2023 (depending on event logistics; additional 4 days of work)
